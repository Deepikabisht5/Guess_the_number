# Guess_the_number
This is a mini project made by python . This is a game in which we write a program that generates random number called target of any range  . The user has to guess the target in minimum tries.
If the number is less than or greater than the target, user will get a message regarding that. At last, user will get the total no. of tries user took to guess the target.
User can also quit the game in between by choosing quit option
